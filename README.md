# Local Overlay Tool
## Written by Dirk Colbry 9/22/23

This tool is designed to mimic the overlay powertools previously written.  I am working to make improvements. The basic usage is as follows:

Step 1: build an overlay 

local_build

Step 1 (alternative 1): build an overlay with miniconda already installed

local_install_conda

Step 1 (alternative 2): build an overlay with miniconda and jupyter already installed

create_jupyter_local_overlay

Step 2: Run the overlay

local_start

That should be it!

We need to work on local_exec and moving to mamba install
